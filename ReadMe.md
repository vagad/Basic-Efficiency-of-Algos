NN vs Brute Force Graph Algorithms 
Project By: Vamsi Gadiraju

This was a fun little project to show the differences in a brute force algorithm vs Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for basic graphs. The display allows users to generate a certain number of random vertices to form a complete graph. From there, the user can determine the shortest path through the graph using the Nearest Neigbor Algo or a brute force algorithm that involves all permutations. The program will have the ability to time each run to compare the time efficiency of each method. AVOID USING LARGE NUMBERS for vertices with the brute force algo!
